### Editing the readme locally will cause the repo to be out of sync.
*Specifically*, the change will not be commited to the repo.

The changes that you would like to save should be staged to commit.

```git status``` will check status (to outline if there are changes and what those changes are)
```git add <filename>``` will add an individual filename
```git add .``` will add all content in the directory (for staging)

```git commit -m "<text>"``` will commit the staged changes with a message associated with the changes
